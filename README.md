# CertiappEthereum
## 📌 Project Overview
CertiApp Ethereum is a simple blockchain-based certificate management dApp. It allows an admin to issue certificates securely using a smart contract written in Solidity. Each certificate contains details like the recipient's name, course, grade, and date. The frontend is built using React and Tailwind CSS, and the data is stored immutably on the Ethereum blockchain.

## ✨ Key Features
🔐 Admin Authentication – Only the contract deployer (admin) can issue certificates.

🏅 Issue Certificates – Admin can add certificate details, which are stored on-chain.

📜 View Certificates – Anyone can read and verify certificates by ID.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
⚛️ Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, Ethers.js

🧾 Smart Contract: Solidity

🔗 Blockchain: Ethereum (works with Hardhat, Sepolia, etc.)
